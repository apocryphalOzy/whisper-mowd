# Whisper MOWD Security Overview

## Executive Summary
Whisper MOWD is a cloud-based audio transcription platform designed with security-first principles to handle sensitive educational data in compliance with HIPAA and GDPR regulations.

## Security Architecture Highlights

### üîê Authentication & Access Control
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Mandatory for all users via AWS Cognito
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions (admin, teacher, student, viewer)
- **JWT Token Management**: Short-lived tokens (15 min) with secure refresh mechanism
- **Zero Trust Model**: Every request authenticated and authorized

### üîí Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AWS KMS with customer-managed keys
  - Separate keys for audio, transcripts, and summaries
  - Automated 90-day key rotation
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum, HSTS enabled
- **Data Segregation**: School-based data isolation
- **Secure Deletion**: Cryptographic erasure with audit trails

### üìä Compliance Implementation
- **HIPAA Technical Safeguards**: All requirements from 45 CFR 164.312
- **GDPR Articles 25, 32-34**: Privacy by design, security of processing
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable logs with 90-day retention
- **Data Retention**: Automated lifecycle policies (30 days audio, 18 months transcripts)

### üö® Security Monitoring
- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: AWS GuardDuty + custom alerting
- **Automated Response**: Lambda-based incident containment
- **Security Metrics Dashboard**: Failed auth, API violations, anomalies
- **Vulnerability Management**: Weekly scans, quarterly pen tests

### üõ°Ô∏è Infrastructure Security
- **DDoS Protection**: CloudFront + AWS Shield
- **Web Application Firewall**: OWASP Top 10 protection
- **Network Isolation**: VPC with private subnets
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager with rotation

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

| Risk Category | Mitigation Approach |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Data Breach | End-to-end encryption, access controls, monitoring |
| Compliance Violation | Automated checks, training, documentation |
| Insider Threat | Audit trails, least privilege, behavioral monitoring |
| Service Disruption | Multi-AZ deployment, auto-scaling, backups |
