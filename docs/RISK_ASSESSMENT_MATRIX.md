# Risk Assessment Matrix - Whisper MOWD Platform

## Risk Assessment Methodology
- **Likelihood Scale**: 1 (Rare) to 5 (Almost Certain)
- **Impact Scale**: 1 (Negligible) to 5 (Critical)
- **Risk Score**: Likelihood × Impact (1-25)
- **Risk Levels**: Low (1-6), Medium (7-14), High (15-19), Critical (20-25)

## Risk Treatment Strategies

### Accept
- Risks with residual score ≤ 4 after mitigation
- Document acceptance rationale
- Review quarterly

### Mitigate
- Primary strategy for all identified risks
- Implement technical and administrative controls
- Monitor effectiveness

### Transfer
- Cyber insurance for financial impact
- AWS shared responsibility model
- Third-party security services

### Avoid
- Not storing unnecessary sensitive data
- Limiting geographic scope initially
- Avoiding high-risk integrations

## Control Effectiveness Metrics

| Control Type | Implementation Status | Effectiveness Score |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Encryption | 100% | 95% |
| Access Control | 100% | 90% |
| Monitoring | 90% | 85% |
| Incident Response | 100% | Not yet tested |
| Backup/Recovery | 100% | 95% |
| Compliance Automation | 80% | 90% |

## Risk Monitoring Plan

### Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time security alerts via CloudWatch
- Daily automated vulnerability scans
- Weekly security metrics review
- Monthly access rights audit

### Periodic Assessments
- Quarterly risk assessment updates
- Semi-annual penetration testing
- Annual third-party security audit
- Compliance assessment before major changes

## Risk Appetite Statement
Whisper MOWD maintains a **low risk appetite** for:
- Security breaches affecting student data
- Compliance violations
- Service availability below 99.9%
- Reputational damage

We accept **moderate risk** for:
