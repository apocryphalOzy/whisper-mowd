## Key Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. "Tell me about your experience with HIPAA compliance"

**Response:**
"I've implemented comprehensive HIPAA compliance for the Whisper MOWD platform, focusing on the technical safeguards required by 45 CFR 164.312. This includes:

- **Access Control**: Implemented unique user identification through AWS Cognito with mandatory MFA, automatic logoff after 30 minutes of inactivity, and encryption using AWS KMS with customer-managed keys.
- **Audit Controls**: Built a complete audit trail using CloudTrail with 90-day retention in CloudTrail Lake, logging all API calls and data access events.
- **Integrity Controls**: Implemented S3 versioning with MFA delete protection and SHA256 checksums for all audio files.
- **Transmission Security**: Enforced TLS 1.3 minimum with HSTS headers and certificate pinning.

I also created a compliance matrix mapping each HIPAA requirement to specific technical controls, and implemented automated compliance checking to ensure ongoing adherence."

### 2. "How would you secure a WebRTC application?"

**Response:**
"Securing WebRTC requires addressing multiple layers:

1. **Signaling Security**: I'd implement WSS with JWT authentication, HMAC signatures for message integrity, and role-based access control for rooms/channels.

2. **Media Security**: Beyond the mandatory DTLS-SRTP, I'd enforce TURN authentication with time-limited credentials, implement strict ICE candidate filtering, and consider forcing TURN relay for privacy-sensitive applications.

3. **Identity Verification**: Implement peer identity verification using an identity provider, require MFA for high-security calls, and maintain a complete audit trail of all connections.

4. **Infrastructure**: Harden STUN/TURN servers with rate limiting and monitoring, implement geographic distribution for resilience, and ensure encrypted storage for any recordings.

5. **Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards for failed authentications, abnormal TURN usage, and quality degradation that might indicate attacks."

### 3. "Walk me through your incident response process"

**Response:**
"I've developed and implemented a comprehensive incident response playbook following the NIST framework:

**Detection (0-15 min)**: Automated alerts from GuardDuty, CloudWatch alarms for unauthorized KMS access, and real-time monitoring dashboards.

**Triage (15-30 min)**: Automated evidence collection including CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, and system snapshots. Impact assessment to determine affected users and data.

**Containment (30-60 min)**: Automated responses like disabling compromised IAM users, updating security groups to block access, and creating forensic snapshots. For Whisper MOWD, I built Lambda functions that automatically contain threats.

**Eradication & Recovery**: Remove threats, rotate credentials, patch vulnerabilities, and restore from known-good backups with verification.

**Post-Incident**: Document timeline, conduct root cause analysis, update playbooks, and handle regulatory notifications (HIPAA within 60 days, GDPR within 72 hours).

I've also established escalation procedures: P1 critical incidents get 15-minute response with immediate CEO notification."

### 4. "What's your experience with cloud security in AWS?"

**Response:**
"I've architected and implemented a complete AWS security infrastructure for Whisper MOWD:

- **IAM & Access Management**: Least privilege policies, assume-role patterns, and temporary credentials for all services
- **Encryption**: KMS implementation with separate keys for different data types, automated 90-day rotation
- **Network Security**: VPC with private subnets, security groups as virtual firewalls, and NACLs for additional protection
- **Monitoring**: GuardDuty for threat detection, Security Hub for compliance, CloudTrail for audit logging
- **Automation**: Terraform for infrastructure as code with security scanning via tfsec
- **Compliance**: Used only HIPAA-eligible services, implemented AWS Config rules for continuous compliance monitoring

I'm particularly proud of the automated incident response system using Lambda functions that can contain threats within minutes."

### 5. "How do you balance security with user experience?"

**Response:**
"Security should enhance trust, not hinder productivity. My approach:

1. **Invisible Security**: Implement strong security that users don't see - encryption, monitoring, and automated threat response happen in the background.

2. **Smart Defaults**: Security by default with opt-out rather than opt-in. For Whisper MOWD, encryption and audit logging are automatic.

3. **Progressive Security**: Basic features require basic authentication, sensitive operations require additional verification. This prevents security fatigue.

4. **User Education**: Clear communication about why security measures exist. For example, explaining that MFA protects their data, not just company assets.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Security controls are optimized to minimize latency. KMS operations are cached, JWT tokens are validated efficiently.

6. **Friction Reduction**: Single sign-on, remember device options for trusted environments, and biometric authentication on mobile."

### 6. "How would you handle a data breach?"

**Response:**
"I would follow our established incident response playbook:

**Immediate Actions (0-15 min)**:
- Activate incident response team
- Contain the breach by isolating affected systems
- Preserve evidence with forensic snapshots
- Begin initial assessment of scope

**Short-term (1-24 hours)**:
- Determine what data was accessed and by whom
- Implement additional monitoring
- Begin root cause analysis
- Prepare initial communications

**Compliance & Notification**:
- Document everything for regulatory requirements
- GDPR: 72-hour notification to authorities
- HIPAA: 60-day notification to affected individuals
- Coordinate with legal and PR teams

**Recovery & Lessons Learned**:
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Implement additional controls
- Update incident response procedures
- Conduct post-mortem without blame

Throughout, I'd maintain transparent communication with stakeholders while protecting the investigation's integrity."

### 7. "What security metrics do you track?"

**Response:**
"I believe in data-driven security. Key metrics I track:

**Operational Metrics**:
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): Currently <5 minutes
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR): Currently <15 minutes
- Patch deployment time: Critical within 24 hours
- Security training completion: 100% quarterly

**Risk Metrics**:
- Vulnerability scan findings trend
- Risk assessment scores by category
- Third-party security ratings
- Compliance audit scores

**Performance Metrics**:
- Failed authentication attempts
- API rate limit violations
- Encryption operations latency
- Security control effectiveness

**Business Metrics**:
- Security incidents impact on SLA
- Cost per security control
- Security ROI calculations
- Customer trust scores

I use these metrics to drive continuous improvement and demonstrate security value to leadership."

### 8. "How do you stay current with security threats?"

**Response:**
"Continuous learning is essential in security:

1. **Threat Intelligence**: Subscribe to AWS Security Bulletins, US-CERT alerts, and industry-specific feeds for education sector threats.

2. **Professional Networks**: Active in security communities, attend RSA/BSides conferences, participate in local ISACA chapter.

3. **Hands-on Practice**: Regular participation in CTFs, maintain home lab for testing new attack techniques and defenses.

4. **Formal Education**: Currently pursuing AWS Security specialty certification, completed GDPR practitioner certification.

5. **Vendor Relationships**: Regular briefings from security vendors, participate in AWS security webinars.

6. **Internal Sharing**: Run monthly security awareness sessions for development teams, share threat intelligence summaries."
