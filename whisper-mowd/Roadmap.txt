1. Infrastructure & Architecture
1. AWS Environment Setup
○ Account Structure: Set up separate AWS accounts or use AWS Organizations
for development vs. production.
○ IAM Roles & Permissions: Define roles for developers, automated build
systems, and production services. Ensure least privilege to protect school and
student data.
○ Networking: Configure VPCs, subnets, and security groups to segregate
public-facing services (e.g., lecture upload portal) from private services (e.g.,
transcription servers).
2. Compute & Storage
○ GPU Instances: Select instance types (e.g., G5 or P4d) suitable for running
Whisper efficiently.
○ Storage: Use Amazon S3 for raw audio and transcribed text. Consider life-cycle
policies to move old data to cheaper storage (S3 Glacier) if needed.
○ Databases: Decide between Amazon RDS (relational) or DynamoDB (NoSQL)
for user accounts, metadata, and logs.
3. High-Level Architecture
○ Load Balancer / API Gateway: Provide a scalable entry point for audio uploads
and retrieval requests.
○ Microservices: Break down logic (upload service, transcription service,
summarization service) for modularity and maintainability.
○ Event-Driven Processing: Use AWS Lambda or an event bus (e.g., Amazon
EventBridge) to trigger transcription upon file upload, ensuring asynchronous
processing.
2. Development & Integration
1. Frontend / User Interface
○ Lecture Upload Portal: Simple drag-and-drop or “Select File” interface for
teachers.
○ Lecture Management Dashboard: Allows educators to see processed lectures,
transcripts, and summarized notes.
○ Student Access Panel: Lightweight, read-only interface displaying transcripts,
summaries, and search functionality.
2. Transcription Service (Whisper)
○ Containerization: Package Whisper in a Docker container for consistent
deployment on EC2 or ECS.

○ Batch vs. Real-Time: Decide if transcriptions happen in real-time (streaming) or
asynchronously (batch processing).
○ Accuracy Tuning: Test different Whisper models (tiny, base, large) to balance
accuracy and speed, especially for varied teacher accents.
3. Summarization Service (ChatGPT or GPT-based Model)
○ API Integration: Connect transcription output to ChatGPT or a custom
GPT-based model via an API call.
○ Prompt Engineering: Design prompts that yield concise, bullet-style summaries
suitable for quick student review.
○ Customization: Allow educators to choose summary length or highlight specific
parts of the lecture (e.g., “key takeaways,” “study notes,” etc.).
4. Metadata & Search
○ Indexing: Store transcripts in a searchable index (e.g., OpenSearch,
ElasticSearch, or a custom full-text search) to help students quickly find specific
sections.
○ Tagging: Automatically label lectures with subjects, topics, or keywords for better
organization.
3. Testing & Validation
1. Unit & Integration Tests
○ Audio Upload Tests: Check file size limits, supported file formats, and upload
concurrency.
○ Pipeline Tests: Ensure that audio files trigger Whisper correctly, produce
transcripts, and feed into ChatGPT for summaries without breaking.
○ Edge Cases: Test noisy audio, incomplete uploads, large lecture files, and poor
microphone quality.
2. Performance Testing
○ Load Testing: Simulate multiple schools uploading lectures concurrently to
identify bottlenecks.
○ Latency Benchmarks: Measure average time from upload to final summary
delivered.
○ Scaling Tests: Use AWS auto-scaling groups or ECS/EKS to verify that capacity
scales with demand.
3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
○ Educator Feedback: Gather insights on user flow, clarity of final
transcripts/summaries, and overall ease of use.
○ Student Feedback: Ensure summaries are helpful for note-taking or reviewing,
and that transcripts are accurate enough for practical study.

4. Security & Compliance
1. Data Protection
○ Encryption: Use SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS for data at rest, and enforce HTTPS/TLS
for data in transit.
○ Access Control: Ensure robust IAM policies limit access to transcripts and
personal data only to authorized staff and students.
2. FERPA / Data Privacy
○ FERPA Compliance: If serving U.S. K-12 institutions, adhere to guidelines on
how student data is stored, accessed, and shared.
○ Role-Based Access: Distinguish teacher vs. student roles, ensuring transcripts
are only accessible within proper bounds.
3. Audit & Monitoring
○ AWS CloudTrail: Track all API calls for compliance audits.
○ Alerts & Logs: Set up Amazon CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activity, cost
spikes, or performance issues.
5. Deployment & Monitoring
1. CI/CD Pipeline
○ Version Control: Use GitHub or GitLab for code repositories.
○ Build & Deploy: Automate builds, container testing, and deploys (e.g., AWS
CodePipeline + CodeBuild, or a third-party tool like Jenkins).
2. Container Orchestration
○ Amazon ECS / EKS: Deploy containers for Whisper and summarization logic.
○ Blue-Green / Rolling Deploys: Reduce downtime during updates and facilitate
quick rollbacks if issues arise.
3. System Monitoring
○ CloudWatch Metrics: Track CPU, memory, and GPU utilization on EC2/ECS.
○ Distributed Tracing: Implement X-Ray or other solutions to visualize the
end-to-end request flow.
○ Logging: Consolidate logs (e.g., using CloudWatch Logs or ELK stack) for quick
debugging and performance insights.
6. Marketing & School Onboarding
1. Pilot Strategy
○ Local School Partnerships: Identify small K-12 institutions willing to participate
in beta testing. Offer discounted pricing or extended free trials.

○ Showcase Results: Use pilot schools’ feedback and testimonials for future
marketing efforts.
2. Value Proposition
○ Improved Accessibility: Helps students with different learning styles or
accommodations.
○ Cost & Time Savings: Frees teachers from manual note distribution; supports
students who miss class.
○ Easy Integration: Minimal training needed for staff and immediate, tangible
benefits.
3. Scaling Outreach
○ EdTech Conferences & Webinars: Present the solution or host a workshop on
“Effective Lecture Capture.”
○ Online Presence: Maintain a content-rich website with case studies, blog posts,
and how-to guides.
○ Referral Programs: Incentivize existing schools to refer other institutions
(discounts, extended features).
7. Financials & Budget Considerations
1. Cost Management
○ AWS Billing Alerts: Set up alerts to monitor usage costs, particularly around
GPU instances.
○ Reserved Instances / Savings Plans: Consider for stable, predictable usage if
the pilot is successful.
○ Cost Optimization: Use container-based autoscaling to shut down resources
when not in use, especially during off-school hours.
2. Revenue Streams
○ Monthly Subscription: Tiered pricing based on the number of lectures or total
usage.
○ Pay-Per-Lecture: Additional fee for institutions needing occasional or ad-hoc
lecture uploads.
○ Support & Custom Integrations: Bundle premium support or integration with
existing LMS systems (e.g., Google Classroom, Canvas) for an extra fee.
3. Break-Even & Profitability
○ $10,000 Monthly Target: Aim for a mix of a few larger schools or multiple
smaller ones to achieve MRR (monthly recurring revenue).
○ Financial Projections: Track user acquisition, churn, and average revenue per
school to forecast growth.

8. Growth & Scalability
1. Feature Roadmap
○ Translations / Multilingual: Expand to support multiple languages for diverse
student populations.
○ Smart Summaries: Incorporate advanced AI-based highlighting, note clustering,
or Q&A.
○ Analytics & Insights: Provide dashboards with lecture metrics (which parts are
re-watched or re-read the most).
2. Geographical Expansion
○ Regional Focus: Start with local or state-level schools before going national or
international.
○ Compliance Across Regions: Be mindful of differing privacy laws or
educational policies in other territories.
3. Long-Term Vision
○ University Market: After proof of concept in K-12, adapt solution for larger
campuses with more complex needs.
○ Corporate Training: Eventually serve professional training, seminars, or industry
conferences.
Putting It All Together
● Roadmap: Use 2-week sprints to tackle each of the above categories in small
increments—plan, execute, test, and refine.
● Cross-Functional Collaboration: Involve educators for real-world feedback, legal
experts for compliance, and cloud architects for scaling decisions.
● Milestone Tracking: Monitor tasks completed, test coverage, pilot satisfaction scores,
and MRR to ensure progress aligns with business objectives.
