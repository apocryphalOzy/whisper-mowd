 Hello, everyone. In a few moments you will hear a test recording, a test recording made by a chat by the name of Alan Shaw of Harbour The Loudspeakers and his colleague Derek Hughes. Alan and Derek used the facilities at the BBC Kingswood War and Hanukkah Chamber.  This was four or five years ago now to make a test recording, a speech, a test recording. It's very useful in highlighting any problems you may have with your audio system, your PC, audio system, your loudspeakers, etc.  It's basically just a very clean recording made in an electric chamber so that the effects of the room are effectively removed from the recording.  What you would hear in a moment is, clipper around ten minutes made under those conditions. So with that any further ado, let's just start the playback.  Here we are on the 28th of June 2007. We are in the BBC Kingswood War and Hanukkah Chamber, Special State indeed.  We've learnt a lot today.  We've learnt a lot today.  The different speech sounds have been moulded into sentences such as the consonants and usual compounds occur in the vowel combinations which are met with very frequently in English.  For lack of time it was not possible to get every group included, although as is shown quite clearly in the figure, up with a 80% are accounted for.  I think nothing else need to be said in this place on the subject.  I'm speechless.  Okay, so I'm now on access like you are.  The different speech sounds which have been moulded into sentences such that the consonants and usual compounds occur in the vowel combinations which are met with very frequently in English.  For lack of time it was not possible to get every group included, although as is shown quite clearly in the figure, up with a 80% are accounted for.  I think nothing else need to be said in this place on the subject.  Have we got a few words for our friends on the user group who would very much like some speech?  I mean what is the secret of a good speech test recording in your experience?  Well it's what we've just done. If you're going to, you're listening to a loudspeaker in the context of your own living room.  What the brain is used to processing is the voices of people that you know in your own living room.  And those voices are the pure voice itself, plus the acoustics of your living room.  So what we've just done is recording a free-field environment and a kind chamber, so we have a pure voice.  Therefore, when you play it through your loudspeaker in your listening room, if your loudspeaker is accurate, it should sound the same as the same person in your living room.  So we've eliminated the environment from recording, from the recording.  And have we used a microphone that we have confidence in?  We do. We do the very best microphones in the world pretty much.  Even the front, a little bit of it, is 600 quid width of mic, isn't it? That's ignoring all the other bits.  Yeah, one of the best microphones in the world.  And we've actually used a B&K 4191 capsule.  And if our listeners are friends are listening back to this, would there be a temptation for them to think that our voices sound soft and quite unlike the quality of voice  as many people perceive it to be these days.  Absolutely. Absolutely. Most broadcasting, let alone recording, is done very, very close to the microphone, which in parts are completely different kinds of the sound.  Most microphones have got a lift in frequency around the sort of 3, 4, 5 kHz area, which gives the voice age and presence and attack.  But could no way be described as natural.  But there is a trend towards what I think you could call a sort of hotening up of sound.  In society, we see that the soft laid back natural sound.  That many hundreds of man-hours or thousands of man-hours here at the B&K worked over what 50, 60 years to perfect.  Has been replaced by a much more aggressive, harder, wiery, brittle sound. I wonder why that is?  I think it's a physiological, sociological loop. I mean, most people, the music, the most people now listen to, is of that elk as well.  The performances they hear are through the same sort of microphones with peaks in the same aggressive loudspeakers.  So they're brains are conditioned now to expecting that, that's what's right.  And of course, if no one's experienced anything different, then they don't know.  If you'd grew up at a child wearing glasses with a red filter, you'd think the world was red.  And someone told you it wasn't, you said, I'm sorry.  It's conditioning because that's what the people are exposed to in most of the time.  And in whose interest is it that commercial sound has become harder? Who drives that process?  Fundamentally has to be recording engineers.  Whether it's because as a result of poor live music systems, PA systems, naturally have that sound.  And then they want to try and reproduce that in the recording studio.  So therefore they're following an inaccurate and compromised sound quality, that's possible.  Whether it's purely because that type of sound, grant the listener has more impact, a bit like turning up the adverse during programs.  It's the same principle you're grabbing someone's ears and attention.  And if it's a commercial reality, over on ear and ear and ear, then that's what people are going to go for.  Well, as that wasn't, you know, the objective was accuracy.  You, when the BBC speakers are developed, when this place was built and such,  you had the facility in place that my devile to walk from a control room from a listening room, direct into where the orchestra was.  So you had an absolutely one perfect comparison of live versus reproduce sound.  Without any recording in between you.  Now, you know, that doesn't exist.  Even, even, console halls these days are often compromised in their sound quality.  Because they're supposed to be multipurpose and such.  Do you believe that accurate speech reproduction is still important then?  Yes, absolutely.  It has to be at the fundamental part of a loudspeaker design because it's what most of the brain processes.  Just as our visual cortex, I think it's 80% is allocated to recognizing faces.  In the same way, a huge proportion of our audible cortex is written to recognizing voices.  So the processing power within the brain, for speech, is enormous compared to anything else.  Even music, even music, because speech came first.  Yeah, so it's very, very crucial.  The difficulty is, I mean, what we've done here is, we can go away and listen to our loudspeakers.  But, of course, even with the passing of years, voice is changed.  It's extremely difficult to be consistent.  And how many loudspeakers these days would you expect to use voice to use speech as a test material as we do?  I would have to guess it's in under 10% I would think.  Well, maybe we're wrong and they're right.  Well, it could be.  Thank you, Derek very much.
