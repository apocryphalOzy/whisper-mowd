 Hello everyone, in a few moments you will hear test recording. Test recording made by a chat by the name of Alan Shaw of Harbath Loudspeakers and his colleague Derek Hughes. Alan and Derek used the facilities at the BBC Kingswood Warren Anacorchamber. This was four or five years ago now to make a test recording, a speech test recording. It's very useful in highlighting any problems you may have with your audio system, your PC audio system, your loudspeakers etc. It's basically just a very clean recording made in an Anacorchamber so that the effects of the room are effectively removed from the recording. What you will hear in a moment is a clip of around 10 minutes made under those conditions. So without any further ado let's just start to start the playback. Well Derek here we are on the 28th of June 2007. We are in the BBC Kingswood Warren Anacorchamber. Spicious day indeed. We've learnt a lot today. We have learnt a lot today. And we had a bit of fun. Yes and we reminisced and we've come home. What have you got? Shall I go first? Absolutely. The different speech sounds have been molded into sentences such the consonants and usual compounds occur in the vowel combinations which are met with very frequently in English. For lack of time it was not possible to get every group included although as is shown quite clearly in the figure up with 80% are accounted for. I think nothing else need be said in this place on the subject. I'm speechless. Okay so I'm now on axis like you were. The different speech sounds which have been molded into sentences such that the consonants and usual compounds occur in the vowel combinations which are met with very frequently in English. For lack of time it was not possible to get every group included although as is shown quite clearly in the figure, outputs of 80% are accounted for. I think nothing else need be said in this place on the subject. Have we got a few words for our friends on the user group who would very much like some speech. I mean what is the secret of a good speech test recording in your experience? Well it's what we've just done. If you're going to you're listening to a loud speaker in the context of your own living room what the brain is used to processing is the voices of people that you know in your own living room and those voices are the pure voice itself plus the acoustics of your living room. So what we've just done is record in a free-field environment and a correct chamber so we have a pure voice therefore when you play it through your loud speaker in your listening room if your loud speaker is accurate it should sound the same as the same person in your living room. So we've eliminated the environment from the recording. Exactly. And have we used a microphone that we have confidence in? We do. We do the very best microphones in the world pretty much. Even the front a little bit of it is six, seven hundred quids worth of mic isn't it? That's ignoring all the other bits. Yeah one of the best microphones in the world. And we've actually used a B&K 4191 capsule. And if our listeners our friends are listening back to this would there be a temptation for them to think that our voices sound soft and quite unlike the quality of voice as many people perceive it to be these days. Absolutely. Absolutely. Most broadcasting that they're in recording is done very very close to the microphone which in parts a completely different character of the sound. Most microphones have got a lift in frequency around the sort of three four five kilohertz area which gives the voice edge and presence and attack but could no way be described as natural. But there is a trend towards what I think you could call a sort of hotening up of sound. In society we see that the soft laid-back natural sound that many hundreds of man hours or thousands of man hours here at the BBC worked over what 50, 60 years to perfect has been replaced by a much more aggressive harder, wiry, brittle sort of sound. I wonder why that is? I think it's a physiological, sociological loop. I mean most people the music that most people now listen to is of that ilk as well. The performances they hear are you know through the same sort of microphones with peaks in the same aggressive loudspeakers so their brains are conditioned now to expecting that's what's right. And of course if no one's experienced anything different then they don't know. It's like if you grew up as a child wearing glasses with a red filter you think the world was red and you know if someone told you it wasn't you say I'm sorry you know it's you know it's conditioning because that's that's what people are exposed to most of the time. And in whose interest is it that commercial sound has become harder? Who drives that process? Fundamentally it has to be recording engineers whether it's because as a result of poor live music systems, PA systems naturally have that sound and then they want to try and reproduce that in the recording studio so therefore they're following an inaccurate and compromised sound quality that's possible. Whether it's purely because that type of sound grabs the listener has more impact a bit like turning up the adverts during programs you know it's the same principle you're grabbing someone's ears and attention and if it's a commercial reality over on here and the else then that's what people are going to go for. Whereas that wasn't you know the objective was accuracy you when the BBC speakers were developed when this place was built and such you had the facility in place like Made of Vale to walk from a control room from listening room direct into where the orchestra was so you had an absolutely one perfect comparison of live versus reproduced sound without any recording in between you. Now you know that just doesn't exist even even concert halls these days are often compromised in their sound quality because they're supposed to be multi-purpose and such. Do you believe that accurate speech reproduction is still important then? Yes absolutely. It has to be at the fundamental heart of the loudspeaker design because it's what most of the brain processes just as our visual cortex I think it's 80% is allocated to recognizing faces in the same way a huge proportion of our audible cortex is to recognizing voices so that the processing power within the brain for speech is enormous compared to anything else. Even music? Even music because speech came first. So it's very very crucial. The difficulty is I mean what we've done here is record the two of us so we can go away and listen to our loudspeakers but of course even with a passing of years voices change so it's extremely difficult to be consistent. And how many loudspeakers these days would you expect to use voice to use speech as a test material as we do? I would hazard a guess it's in under 10% I would think. Well maybe we're wrong and they're right. Well it could be. Thank you Derek very much.
