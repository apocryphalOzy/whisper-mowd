Concise Game Plan for Implementing School-Focused Cloud Transcription &
Summarization
Project Overview: Develop a cloud-based platform that uses OpenAI Whisper for lecture
transcription and ChatGPT for summarization, tailored specifically for schools. The goal is to
pilot with local or smaller schools for early adoption, then scale across multiple educational
institutions.
1. Business Vision & Scope
● Focus: Deliver affordable, accessible transcription and summarization services to
schools.
● Expansion: Once successful in schools, expand to colleges, universities, and corporate
training.
● Timeline: Achieve monthly recurring revenue of $10,000 by December 2025.
2. Key Objectives
1. Establish MVP for Schools (Q1–Q2 2025)
○ Basic pipeline for uploading lectures, transcribing via Whisper, and summarizing
with ChatGPT.
2. Pilot Test with Initial Schools (Q3 2025)
○ Onboard at least 3 schools for real-world testing.
3. Refine & Scale (Q4 2025)
○ Expand to more institutions, optimize performance, and approach $10k MRR.
3. Implementation Steps
Phase 1: Planning & Setup (Q1 2025)
1. AWS Configuration
○ Create AWS environment and set up S3, EC2, IAM roles.
○ Decide on GPU instance type (e.g., G5, P4) for Whisper.
2. MVP Requirements
○ Outline core features (audio upload, transcription, summarization, simple UI).

○ Build cost projections for AWS usage.
3. Market Feasibility
○ Identify local K-12 schools interested in a pilot.
○ Draft basic marketing materials emphasizing accessibility and cost benefits.
Phase 2: MVP Development (Q2 2025)
1. Core Application
○ Audio Upload: Implement web interface for educators to upload lectures.
○ Transcription: Integrate Whisper (Python or containerized approach) on EC2.
○ Summarization: Connect results to ChatGPT or a GPT-based API for short,
bullet-style summaries.
2. User Management
○ Set up basic login system for teachers and administrators.
3. Testing & Validation
○ Use sample audio from cooperating educators.
○ Collect feedback on transcript accuracy and summary clarity.
Phase 3: Pilot Launch (Q3 2025)
1. Onboard Schools
○ Pilot with 3 partner schools.
○ Provide user training on uploading lectures and accessing summaries.
2. Feedback Loop
○ Gather feedback from staff and students.
○ Identify must-have vs. nice-to-have improvements.
3. Security & Compliance
○ Implement encryption at rest (S3) and in transit (HTTPS).
○ Ensure student data protection (FERPA compliance if applicable).
Phase 4: Refinement & Expansion (Q4 2025)
1. Platform Enhancements
○ Improve transcript accuracy and summarization logic.
○ Add performance monitoring to reduce latency.
○ Implement advanced features like note highlighting.
2. Marketing & Growth
○ Develop case studies from pilot schools.
○ Present at educational conferences (in-person or virtual).
○ Scale up AWS infrastructure to handle more schools.
3. Financial Checkpoint
○ Evaluate monthly revenue; target $10,000 to break even.

○ Assess readiness to move full-time into the business.
4. Sprint Structure
● Length: 2-week sprints.
● Time Allocation: 10–15 hours/week while working full-time.
● Backlog Priorities:
1. Core MVP tasks (upload, transcribe, summarize).
2. Pilot feedback integration.
3. Marketing & outreach tasks.
5. High-Level Timeline
● Q1 2025 (Sprints 1–3):
○ Finalize architecture, set up AWS, confirm pilot schools.
● Q2 2025 (Sprints 4–6):
○ Build MVP, test with sample lectures.
● Q3 2025 (Sprints 7–9):
○ Launch pilot with 3 schools, gather feedback.
● Q4 2025 (Sprints 10–12):
○ Refine platform, broaden marketing, push towards $10k MRR.
6. Risk Management
● Resource Constraints: Carefully monitor AWS expenses; set alerts.
● Compliance: Follow FERPA guidelines for U.S. K-12 data privacy.
● Adoption Barriers: Provide clear training and simple user experience to encourage
usage.
Conclusion: This concise but detailed plan focuses on deploying your platform in schools first.
By methodically developing and piloting the MVP, refining based on real-world feedback, and
gradually scaling, you can position yourself to reach $10,000 MRR by the end of 2025.
Leverage your existing web design client base to establish credibility, and prioritize user-friendly

features to build momentum within the education sector.
